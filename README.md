# 0xSh3x

Automate reconnaissance. Stop running 10 different tools manually. Let 0xSh3x handle it.

## Requirements

- Linux or WSL
- Bash 5.0+
- curl, jq, wget, git
- Go 1.19+ (for Go tools)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ly0kha/0xsh3x.git
cd 0xsh3x
chmod +x 0xsh3x.sh
./0xsh3x.sh --install-deps
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic scan
./0xsh3x.sh target.com

# With Tor (stealth)
./0xsh3x.sh target.com --tor

# Single domain only
./0xsh3x.sh target.com --single

# Custom scope
./0xsh3x.sh --scope scope.txt --tor
```

## What It Automates

- Subdomain enumeration (6 sources in parallel)
- DNS validation and harvesting
- HTTP probing (automatically find live hosts)
- Technology fingerprinting
- URL discovery (Wayback + crawling + active)
- JavaScript analysis and secret extraction
- Port scanning
- Directory discovery
- Security headers audit
- WAF/CDN detection
- Open redirect hunting
- Exposed file discovery (.env, .git, credentials)

## Output

Results saved to 0xsh3x_results/:

```
0xsh3x_results/
├── 01-subdomains/       (all found domains)
├── 02-hosts/            (live hosts + analysis)
├── 03-directories/      (discovered paths)
├── 04-javascript/       (JS files + secrets)
├── 05-urls/             (all URLs found)
├── 06-security/         (headers, WAF, tech)
├── 07-ports/            (open ports)
└── 08-reports/          (final report)
```

## Time Saved

- Manual recon: 30-40 hours per target
- With 0xSh3x: 1-2 hours per target
- Automation gain: 95% faster

## Features

- 12-phase workflow
- Parallel execution
- Resume on interrupt
- Tor/proxy support
- Scope enforcement
- Smart rate limiting
- Infrastructure mapping
- Secrets detection

## Configuration

Most features work out of the box. If you want to customize:

```bash
CONNECTION_METHOD="tor"        # tor, proxy, direct
SCOPE_TYPE="wildcard"          # wildcard, single, custom
OUTPUT_DIR="./0xsh3x_results"
```
